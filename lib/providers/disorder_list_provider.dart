        'Sciatica is a condition that is often caused by pressure put on the sciatic nerve',
        'This pressure usually occurs due to herniation of a disc in the spine or the overgrowth of a bone which are often also called as bones spurs',

          'Scapular Dyskinesis is an alteration or deviation in the normal resting or active position of the Scaplua during shoulder movement. Scapular rotation is important for proper shoulder function and it can move in abnormal ways due to repetitive use of the shoulder. The Scapula (shoulder blade) also serves as a stable base for rotator cuff activation and functioning. Any bony or soft tissue injury around the shoulder can alter the roles of the scapula in motion or at rest.',

        'Weakness, imbalance,tightness or detachment of the muscles that control the scapula',
